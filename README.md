# Hi, I’m Shown 👋

I’m an aspiring cloud and backend engineer learning AWS fundamentals while building and documenting real projects.

I focus on **understanding systems**, integrating APIs, and explaining what I know clearly rather than overselling myself.

---

## What I’m currently focused on
- AWS core services: EC2, Auto Scaling, IAM (learning in progress)
- Writing structured technical notes and maintaining clean Git history
- Strengthening backend and cloud fundamentals

📘 AWS notes: [aws-learning](https://github.com/ShownShaiju/aws-learning)

## Technical Skills

### Backend & Databases
- Python
- Django (project-level experience)
- SQL (joins, subqueries, basic optimization)
- PHP (API integration project)

### Cloud & DevOps (learning)
- AWS EC2
- Auto Scaling
- Basic infrastructure concepts
- Git & GitHub

### Frontend (basic working knowledge)
- HTML
- CSS (can modify and debug layouts)
- JavaScript (basic logic and API usage)

### AI / ML Exposure
- Computer vision basics
- YOLO-based object and hand sign detection
- Model training and inference workflows (project-based)

---

## Selected Projects

### AWS Learning Notes
Structured documentation of AWS concepts with scenarios, refinements, and Git-based version tracking.  
Focuses on understanding behavior, not memorization.

### Hand Sign Detection using YOLO
- Built a hand sign detection system using YOLO
- Trained the model and handled inference pipeline
- Used external resources and ChatGPT as learning aids
- Focused on understanding data flow and model behavior

---

### AI Mock Interview Platform (Guided + Extended)
- Built by following a JavaScript Mastery tutorial
- Extended functionality by:
  - Using Gemini API for interview question generation
  - Storing data in Firebase
  - Integrating voice input/output using VAPI
- Project kept to reflect learning and extension, not originality

---

### Travel Expense Estimator (PHP)
- Built a backend project using raw PHP
- Integrated multiple APIs for:
  - Distance calculation
  - Fuel price estimation
- Focused on business logic and API integration  
*(Repository not yet published)*

## How I use GitHub
- To document learning honestly
- To track improvement over time
- To build habits aligned with real engineering workflows

I prefer **clarity over hype** and **understanding over buzzwords**.
