Hi, I’m Shown 👋  

I’m learning cloud and backend fundamentals and building projects while documenting my progress in public.

Currently focused on:
- AWS core services (EC2, Auto Scaling)
- Backend development with Python
- Practical AI exposure (model training, agent integration in web apps)
- Git and clean version control practices
