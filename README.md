# Hi, I’m Shown 👋

Cloud & Backend focused engineer building strong AWS fundamentals in public.

I document what I learn, refine it over time, and turn theory into system-level understanding.

---

## 🔍 Current Focus

- AWS core architecture (EC2, Auto Scaling, ALB, VPC, IAM)
- Serverless systems (Lambda, API Gateway, S3, CloudFront)
- Databases (RDS Multi-AZ, Read Replicas, DynamoDB design patterns)
- Messaging systems (SNS, SQS, DLQ)
- Clean Git workflows and structured documentation
- Backend development with Python
- Practical AI exposure (model training, agent integration in web apps)
---

## 🧠 What I’m Doing Differently

Instead of rushing projects, I’m:

- Building deep architectural clarity first
- Connecting services across real-world scenarios
- Understanding scaling, availability, and failure patterns
- Learning cost behavior, not just configuration steps

Theory → Mental model → Deployment.

## 🚧 Upcoming Hands-On Builds

- Static site deployment with S3 + CloudFront + Route 53  
- EC2 application behind ALB with Auto Scaling  
- Lambda + API Gateway microservice  
- RDS Multi-AZ failover test setup
